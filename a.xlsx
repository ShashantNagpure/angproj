Project Mission and Description
Future Clearing & Collateral system are suite of applications which takes care of front to back flow (Trading, Allocation, Clearing, Settlement, Reporting) for Exchange Traded Derivatives and Clearing and Settlement for OTC derivatives
, Handling complex clearing and settlement processes, these applications provide the back bone for all the trades right after they are traded on/off exchange till final delivery/settlement takes place.
TMG/ Fusion Clear: TMG/FC is combination of multiple middle office services that offers portal to Clear the trades to internal Operations.  It has connectivity to multiple systems (front office, Exchanges across the globe, Client/House Allocation systems, Book Keeping systems etc) and does a lot of processing matching and clearing of the requests for entire ETD Futures/Options. 
From technology and learning perspective, we are developing the home grown solution to replace one of the industry wide used Clearing platform Clear vision from vendor FIS publicly known as CV.  The product that we are building is complex, and helps individuals to gain a strong base on technology and business. From technology front, we have Java, Spring, Kafka, Gemfire, Graphite, hibernate used heavily. Platform is both Windows and Linux.
Candidate we are looking forward should be quick learner and flexible to explore new technologies and platforms, also offer fresh perspective in whole scheme of things since we are in a phase to revamp the existing application to an entire new future ready model."
